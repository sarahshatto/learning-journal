## Git Tutorials and Comprehensive guide
Before explaining Git, you must first go back and explain **Version Control**. <br>

**_Version Control_** is a system that allows you to revisit various versions of a file or set of files by recording changes or 'snapshots'. 
- Through version control, you can: 
  - revert a project or file to a previous version. 
  - track modifications
  - compare changes

By using a Version Control System, mistakes can easily be revisited and corrected.

CVCS uses a single server to track and store all changes and file versions, can be accessed by various clients, and generally streamlined the process with the doors opened up for collaboration. 

### Distributed Version Control Systems
