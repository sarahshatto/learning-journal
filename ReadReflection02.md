## Learning about text editors
A **text editor** is a piece of software that allows you to write and manage text, particularly text use to build and create websites.<br>
- Can be downloaded and installed on your computer or accessed via web browser.

### What should you look for in a text editor?
1. Code completion
1. Syntax Highlighting 
1. Variety of themes 
1. Variety of Extensions

#### Code Completion
- As you're typing, suggested code will appear. Sometimes will include closing tags.

  - *As a side note, look for an extension named, "Emmet", as it helps you write your HTML/CSS more efficiently. 
  Some text editors have Emmet built in. Or can be added by extension in others*
  
 #### Syntax highlighting 
 - Once the program recognizes your tag, it will colorize the text to make it more readable. Helpful for quick identification.
 
 #### Themes
 - Themes allow you to change visuals within the editor such as background color, text color, etc...
   - Particularly useful for less strain on the eyes 
   
#### Extensions 
- Continued customization as you grow as a coder, can provide further features to make your coding faster and more efficient.
