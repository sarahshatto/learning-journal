## Javascript & JQuery notes

#### Javascript Book: 1-24, 74-79, 88-94 
- Javascript makes websites more interactive and user friendly.
  - by accessing and modifying content/markup used in a web page while its being viewed in the browser.
  - can change new CSS rules. 
  - change the size of an <img> element. 
  - you can set up a set of instructions that will change the content. 
    - Ex: Pictures that get bigger when you click on them
  - React to certain user input
    - Button is pressed
    - link is clicked
    - cursor hover
    - info added to a form
    - webpage loading


#### Examples of Javascript in the Browser 
- Access the content of page
- modify the content of a page
- program rules/instructions browser can follow
- react to events triggered by the user or broswer.

### Slifeshows (ch. 11)
-  can display multiple images in the same space and can play automatically or user clicking through. 
  - Example: 
    - React- script is triggered when page loads
    - Access- Get each slide from the slideshow
    - Modify- only show the first slide...

### Forms: 
- Validating whether forms have been filled out correctly. 
- Javascript lets you alert the user if there are mistakes. 
- sophisticated calculations 
  - Example
    - user presses submit button after name entry
    - access: get value from form field. 
- Reload only part of a page for speed 
- Filtering data from user input


## Script
-  Series of instructions that the computer will follow to achieve a goal.
  - First step in writing a script is to state your goal.
  - Then list the steps necessary to achieve that goal. 
  - Code your steps. 

Example page 18-19

## Defining a goal and designing a script 

- define your goal
- break into a series of tasks

## Expressions: 

- page 74-79

- Expression evaluates into (or results in) a single value. 
  - Two types of expressions: 
    - Expressions that assign a value to a variable. 
      - Gives variable a value via the assignment operator. 
      - var color = 'beige'; 
    -Expressions that use two or more values to return a single value. 
      - var area = 3 * 2;   

## Types of operators:

- Operator: Allows programmers to create a single value from one or more values. 

Types of Operators: 
  - Assignment Operators: Assign a value to a variable.
    - color = 'beige'; 
    - pg. 61 
  - Arithmatic Operators: perform basic math
    - area = 3 * 2; 
    - pg 76
  - String operators: Combines two strings
    - greeting = 'Hi' + 'Molly'
    - pg 78
  - Comparison Operators: Compares 2 values and returns as True or False
    - buy = 3 > 5; 
    - pg 150
  - Logical Operators: Combines expressions and returns as true or false. 
    - Page 156

## Functions pg. 88-94: 

- Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of the same task, you can reuse the same function. 

- wraps an area/group of code so that it does something. Ex: function (TriviaTime)

- If you want your tasks to happen later, you need to name them. 
  - it should describe the task it's performing.
  - when you ask it to perform its task - it's calling the function. 

- Steps that a function needs to perform in order to perform the task are packaged up in a code block. 
  - refresher: code block consists of one or more statements within curly brackets. 

- Some functions need to be given info in order to complete a task. 
- pieces of information passed to a function is called "parameters". 

-When you write a function and you expect it to provide you an answer, the response is known as a return value. 

1. First, you must declare the function. Give it a name and then write the statements needed to acheive taks inside the curly brackets. 

1. Call the function: after declaring the function, you can then execute all of the statements between curly braces with just one line of code.
