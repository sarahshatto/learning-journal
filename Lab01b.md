### Growth Mindset
A growth mindset is the idea that we're all in the process of learning something new- and we're all in different phases of learning as "forever students". New challenges are just new opportunities. Obstacles are still difficult, but not impossible. Less comparing and and more cheering on of yourself and others around you to be the best we can all be together. Criticism is not a personal attack but is constructive feedback, urging you on to be better. Seeing the opportunity to get discouraged and choosing to persist instead.

>“For what it's worth: it's never too late or, in my case, too early to be whoever you want to be. There's no time limit, stop whenever you want. You can change or stay the same, there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. And I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life you're proud of. If you find that you're not, I hope you have the strength to start all over again.” <br>
> -F. Scott Fitzgerald <br><br>

### Reminders to myself- How to keep on a growth mindset: 
- Be inspired by the success of others around you, and ask for help on how to get there. (Comparison is the enemy)
- Anything worth learning requires practice and failure. #Failup
- Just because it's hard doesn't mean you shouldn't try.
