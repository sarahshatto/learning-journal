## How computers work: What makes a computer a computer? 

#### Main tasks all computers do: 
- Take input
- Store information
- Process that information
- Output information

#### INPUT Devices: 
- Keyboard
- Mouse
- Touch screen
- Etc...

#### Storing information
- Input is then stored in memory. Computer then takes that information from memory, manipulates it, and then sends processed info to be stored in memory again. This process continues until the processed information is ready to be output. 

#### OUTPUT: 
- How a computer outputs info depends on the computer and what it's designed to do. 
  - displays text/photo/videos
  - games, virtual reality
  - sends signals
  - etc...

## Data and Binary
-  Series of 1's and 0's
- used mostly underneath the surface 
- electric wires and circuits store and carry all information in computer. 
- electricity used to carry information-
  - the current of electricity, whether on or off, will signal a yes/no or true/false using a single wire. More wires = more decisions or more complex decisions. 
  - This yes/no outcome is called a "Bit" and is the smallest piece of information that can be stored on a computer. 
- More wires > More Bits > More complex information. 

## Binary Number system: 

- Decimal system uses numbers 0-9 to count, and uses place holders of 1's, 10's, 100's, 1000's, etc...
- Binary can only use 1 and 0, and the place holders are multipliers of 2- 1's, 2's, 4's and 8's, etc...

- All information can be represented as numbers: 
  - letters in the alphabet can be assigned a number, numerical value can translate text into binary.
  - images can be communicated via pixels. Each pixel has a color, and each of the colors can be communicated with numbers. Ex: RGB System
    - Millions of pixels per image > average video uses 30 images per second = a ton of information to process. 
  - Sounds can be measured via wavelength/vibrations- those frequencies can be charted and plotted on a graph, each point on the graph can be represented by a numberical value. More bits = more numbers = higher quality sound. 


## Circuits and Logic: 

- Input and output are both considered information that can be represented by on/off electrical signals. AKA Binary 1's and 0's. 
  - In order to process information or input, computers need to modify and combine input signals.  
    - a computer uses millions of tiny electric components, which come together to form circuits. 

- Circuits can modify and process information represented in 1's and 0's. 

A simple circuit takes information and flips it. So for example, if your input is 1, it will return 0. They call this kind of circuit a "not". 

A secondary circuit carries two electrical signals, each could be a 1 or a 0. If a zero is present in either line, you will always get 0. So the only way you get a result of 1 is if both lines give you a 1. They call this circuit an "and". 

- Complicated circuits take multiple signals and combine them to get different results. 
- Multiple circuits within close proximity = complex calculations done quickly since they're placed so closely together and information can move at the speed of light. 

## Memory, CPU, Input and Output

- All computers do the same four things: 
1. Input
1. Process
1. Store
1. Output

different parts of the computer handle different parts of each task. 

Input devices: 
- mouse
- keyboard
- audio
- video
- car 
- touchscreen
- thermostat
- etc..

1. Input is converted into binary information and sends it to the memory to be stored.
1. Information is sent to the CPU to calculate, and sent back to the memory
1. Information is converted to output

## Example of how input gets to output: 

1. Pressing the letter 'B' on your computer
1. keyboard converts to binary and sends information to CPU 
1. CPU uses number to calculate how to display B pixel by pixel
1. CPU request information from memory on how to draw the letter B
1. CPU runs instructions in stores the results in memory.
1. Pixel information is sent to display as an output device.

## Hardware and Software

- CPU is the master chip that controls all things
  - Utilizes circuits to do simple math and logic
  - Other circuits are used to send and receive information to and from different parts of a computer
- Binary is the simplest form of software â€“ but no one writes in binary anymore.
  - Software currently use today for similar use:
    - Python, Ruby, Blockly
- Software tells the CPU what to do.

-OS: 
  - The operating system is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer.
  - Masters all software and allows you to download other software into computer's memory.
  - Decides when a program is run by the CPU and whether that program can access the input and output devices associated with the computer.
