Hello, Friend! I know you've been interested in learning more about using Markdown in GitHub,
<br> and I've created a simple blog for you to follow along and learn a few tips and tricks! <br>

Let's begin! 
<br> 

**Markdown** is a light language for generating HTML files. 

Here are a few fun things that Markdown can do! 

## Basic text formatting options:
- **bold**
- *italic*
- Add images
- create lists
  - and sublists!
1. and numbered lists!
- tables
- [ ] lists with check boxes <br>
and many more options! 

### Bold text 
- For **bold** text, use ** on either side of your words.

### Italic text 
- For *italic* text, use * on either side of your words.

### Add images
- To add an image to your file, use ![ description of your photo ](link to your photo here)

### Create lists
#### There are several ways to create an unordered list: 
- using dashes - or * asterisks to utilize bullet points:
  - or add two spaces before your - or * and create a sublist! 
  - Wow. How magical. 
  
Numbered lists can be created by a simple <br>
1.<br>
2.<br>
3.<br>

or by using "1." on every line and allowing the program to do the numbering for you.
<br>This can be useful for longer lists.
